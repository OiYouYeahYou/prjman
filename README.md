> The local project forge

## Motivation

Managing the multiple projects on local disk, it can become tedious to manage.
This project aims to give a graphical overview of your projects.

### Not a versioning tool

This project is not intended to reinvent versioning in GUI. There are many
great GUI's out there already. Instead it aims to be versioning aware.
